## FAST&FAIR

This implementation for FAST&FAIR is the version where
the bug of FAIR algorithm is fixed, but we found it still 
has some problems sometimes returning NULL values in our 
benchmarks. As we could not solve these problems in our own, 
please refer to [the original repository](https://github.com/DICL/FAST_FAIR) for more supports.
